SublimeIntegration
==================
Sublime integration for Fuse Editor

How to install
=================
Go to AppData/Roaming (Type %appdata% in file explorer). Find the "Sublime Text 3" folder, and go into "Packages".
Clone repo into this folder, and RENAME the folder to "Fuse", and restart sublime if it's already open.

This is temporary install solution. There will be an eaiser way of doing this in the future.
